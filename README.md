# Fire Simulation

###

This directory contains an emulator to simulate a forest fire on the Numworks calculator or on your computer. To install the libraries needed to run it on your computer, go to the [Visuel](https://github.com/Archange-py/Visuel) repository. To install it on the Numworks, go directly [here](https://my.numworks.com/python/archange/fire_simulator), then upload it directly to the calculator. On the other hand, the example file must be copied and pasted manually into a script created on the Numworks site.

## General Info

In this project, the forest is represented by a matrix of dimension N, and contains forest plots in different states: alive, on fire or burnt. You can change many of the parameters, including the probability of burning (wind strength), the colors of the 3 possible states, the size of the plots and their spacing, the position of the matrix...
